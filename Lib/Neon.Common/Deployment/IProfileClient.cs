    /// This interface supports two kinds of secrets: passwords and values.  These are somewhat

    /// a 1Password item <b>value field.</b>  We found this distinction useful because 1Password
    /// reports when passwords are insecure or duplicated but we have other secrets where these
    /// checks can be distracting.  Custom implementation can choose to follow this pattern or
    /// just treat both types of secret the same.

    /// This is useful for obtaining both the username and password from a login, or all of the different
