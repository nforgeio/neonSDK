Notes
-----
This project holds the Docker files and Powershell scripts for building the NEONSDK 
container images.  Use the **publish.ps1** script to publish multiple images (controlled
by optional switch parameters) or you can CD into the individual image directories and
execute the **publish.ps1** script there to build and publish just that image.
